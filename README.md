 ## Explanation of some pages and functions
 
 ### 1. Product detail page
 - When you click the `detail` button of any product in `product.html` page, it will redirect to the `details.html` page with the URL have a parameter call `id` which is the id of the product you clicked.
 - In the `details.js` file, the id of product will be got and when fetch API, it will render the information followed by that id and inner it into HTML file.
 
 ### 2. Nested comment
 - We use `localStorage` to store the information comment of the users.
 - When the page is loaded, if there have any comment in localStorage, it will be rendered.

 > <sub> This is the box for user to input their comment, and when they click the `Add` button the comment will be rendered. (User must filled the username and the content of the comment or the alert of error will appear.) </sub>

 > <sub> If you click the butoon `reply`, a box similar the comment box will appear with the `Submit` button. <sub>
 - The comment was added by this box is the level 2 comment and put in the `childList` with the number in `id` is 0.
- If you more reply comment in the reply box, it'll be put in the `childList` id with the number increase follow the level.

 **The flow of code**
- When user click `Add` button, the code will create a new object and save it to localStorage, it includes:
  - `id`: the length of the comment array have in the localStorage.
  - `username`: the username that user input in the `username` field.
  - `content`: the content of comment that user input in the box.
  - `like`: the number of user clicked this button, default when it created is 0.
  - `dislike`: the number of user clicked this button, default when it created is 0.
  - `lastUpdated`: use `new Date()` function to store the time when it was created.
  - `childrenIds`: the array will store the childList id when the comment have replies.
  - `parentId`: the id of the higher level comment when it is a reply comment.
- After clicked, the page will render the comment on the screen without reload.
- The level of comment will be divided by their id.

## Drawbacks and bugs in website
1. In the list of product, it have the `quantity` propertiy in it. And it may have some products with the quantity is 0, but when you click the `Add to cart` button, it still be added to cart.
2. If you increase the quantity of product in the `details.html` page, and click `Add to cart` it just add one product to the cart.
3. The nested comment when you alway reply the comment before it, it make a pyramid of comment like this:

4. The performance of the `product.html` page and `details.html` is quite low (maybe a few seconds) because of the Api.
